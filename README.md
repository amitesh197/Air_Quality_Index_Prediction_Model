# Air_Quality_Index_Prediction_Model

This model predicts the Air Quality Index of a city by providing the AQI facors through user input.

Used many regression models such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, XG Boost Regressor and AdaBoost Regressor.

Evaluated every technique through metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and R-squared Error.

Finally came to the conclusion that Random Forest gave the best results.

Thus made a Random Forest Regression model to predict the Air Qaulity.
